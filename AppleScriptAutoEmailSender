Hello 

My name is Jonathan, I saw your ad online looking for a native and qualified teacher for English, teaching is my passion and I am sure that I would be an excellent addition to your team. 

I have a working holiday visa which will let me work in Spain so that will not be a problem. 

I'm currently working as an English teacher in Cuenca and graduated with a degree in foreign languages in University. If you have any more questions about me feel free to contact me.

Thank you for considering my application. 

Jonathan Pitcher

Good evening

My name is Jonathan, I saw your ad online looking for a qualified teacher for English, teaching is my passion and I am confident that I would be an excellent addition to your team. I'm currently finishing my contract as an English teacher in Spain in a public High School with children that are between eleven to thirteen years old. I have a ticket to arrive in Taiwan at the beginning of June.

I graduated with a bachelor's degree in foreign languages in University, after High School in the United States I decided to get my degree from Europe to have real life experience in another country and this helps me understand the challenges that English learners face when learning another language. My resume is attached to this email along with my diplomas, passport, cover letter and photo of myself in the same document. My Skype ID is live:6f78c623195ba614.

Thank you for considering my application.

Jonathan Pitcher
